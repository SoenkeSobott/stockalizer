Clearly based on how underpriced it is other people are not seeing it. Too busy having a circlejerk meeting on Zoom, I guess.  I love when I can get quality, profitable tech for undervalued prices, because it&39;s just so darn rare, as I recently saw with $INTC and $ORCL. Imo anything tech-based, that&39;s profitable, that&39;s trading undervalued, the investor needs to jump on, because the sector naturally skews toward overvaluations, which makes deep value even deeper.  Looking over toward financials: $400M cash. $1.5M current assets against $300M current debt, so $1.5B working cap. Very well-balanced company. $2B in sh equity. Trading at $2.5B.

The good: He doesn&39;t seem to be aware of the details so hopefully the 25k jobs this would create and the taxes the US would receive would incentivize him to sign off.     My take: I think there&39;s a chance he caves, but he seemed set on having a US company get majority stake. I think he, unfortunately, ultimately turns it down because he feels slighted by China and he hates them. The right move politically is to accept it but if I were in his position I&39;d make the emotional move and say no deal to flex on them. The deal they put together doesn&39;t really meet any of the requirements is almost insulting."

He has vocally expressed support for the President and reportedly hosted a major fundraiser for him this year where donors who paid $100,000 were offered a chance to golf with Trump. Nor will the scrutiny be limited to Ellison; Oracle CEO Safra Catz shares close ties with Trump as well. She has donated more than $130,000 to Trump&39;s reelection efforts this year, according to Federal Election Commission data.

The IPO will have anywhere between $100 to $300 billion market cap. Depending on Oracle&39;s stake, but I don&39;t think it would be less than 10% stake. It could be as big as 20%.

The deal stops short of a full sale of the popular video app, but should help to allay Trump&39;s national security concerns regarding Chinese influence over Tik Tok.  The president had accused the app, mostly used by young people to post short videos ranging from dances to make-up tutorials, of being a threat to US national security."

2020-09-14 02:51:13,$MSFT $ORCL Microsoft will not be impacted by the TicToc deal. Why? Because it‚Äôs a relevant company with a suite of in demand product pipeline. Oracle on the other hand has been playing catch up for the last 9 years. I worked with their tech for many years and they are so big they are not efficient and behind the curve. We moved to Salesforce which is stealing their customers at an enormous clip. They are desperately trying to be relevant and current. There is no innovation happening which is why they had to buy this. Mark my words they will curse this product and it will be another My Space in a few years. I hope dumb people sell MS tomorrow so I can buy some cheapies!
2020-09-14 02:50:26,$MSFT losing this deal is good for $FB too Reels.  $ORCL gets no algo just data stores and maybe piece of advertising...Facebook has all of the above.

Watch for a reverse to uptrend on the 5 minute and make your entry for a day trade.  If it runs to the upper area of the channel, it would be about a 6% gain for the day.  Something to try.

2020-06-17 01:34:29,"$SPY $TVIX $ORCL I shorted 4,000 shares of ORCL with about 30 secs left to go in the mkt (SEE BELOW), then covered $2 lower after the earnings release. I  rarely take a position into earnings. So why ORCL (other than I did my homework)? Yesterday options traders on CNBC were showing bullish option flow suggesting a pop after earnings. Also, an analyst just upgraded to Outperform with $62 tgt. And, as I read the opinions on Stocktwits - they were almost all bullish. So what did I do? I took the other side. As I&39;ve mentioned to you all before, when everyone leans one way, consider the other way as an option, it sometimes pays.   Which leads me to Jim  Bianco, a huge bear turned bull as of very recent. He gave his reasoning on CNBC today. And it certainly makes sense. However, the mkt bulls DO NOT want to see this become a pattern. Notorious bears turning bullish (a la Dennis Gartman theory). Because when the room fills up with bulls, and the siren sounds .. well, there is only one door."

2020-02-19 17:19:18,$TSLA they say shorts always looooooose. But guess what. We are quite often correct. Years worth. This time it is Larry Ellison $ORCL and Elon Musk. You have duplicated the lies and stupidness and hypocrisy. This stock will double plunge. Please study if you want to protect your wealth. Both men are super wealthy and they could give a shit about you.
2020-02-19 15:00:54,$TSLA LARRY JUST PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN. HE IS AS EVIL AS THEY GET AND MUSK JUST FELL INTO THE TRAP.  He will be forced by either the investor or the board to fire Ellison. Ellison will dump his stock and Musk will again go back to being erratic. I wish you good luck. $ORCL atherealhypocrite
2020-02-19 10:46:54,$TSLA analysts didn&39;t look at politics and Ellison and it is not baked into the price.. Neither are the revisions in guidance. IMO they are in major problems and that is why Ellison is holding this enormous fund raiser to ask Trump a huge favor. $ORCL
2020-02-19 10:43:04, pointed it out. @$@$ scum bag Ellison is holding a Trump fund raiser to protect Elon Musk from defaulting or pull some scam to protect jobs. $TSLA It is now so obvious and Ellison is getting some major heat from $ORCL backing Trump. Musk and Ellison will use anything even if it is against their principals to go to bed with the mob. I hope Musk reports some really bad revisions. There is no way he is getting away without a revision in guidance.
2020-02-19 08:46:04,$TSLA If Ellison gets asked to be removed from the board because of the association with Trump. I believe it will not only hurt Elon Musk but it will hurt Tesla. Ellison is the reason why Elon Musk has calmed down. $ORCL is already putting pressure on him.
2020-02-19 08:19:30,so this is UNBELIEVABLE! Larry Ellison is a Trumpster and hosts some of the biggest fundraisers for Trump. He is on the board of $TSLA and $ORCL is beginning him to cancel it because it will hurt the brand. So technically Ellison is a hypocrite. He is an opportunist like Musk. But Ellison obviously supports a company that is trying to be green and Trump is anti-global warming. What bunch of bullshit artists. I told you this was a scam.

So I could have sold them for a lot more money (double!) if I waited  a few more minutes. The good news is the short strangle worked out well because both options will expire worthless tomorrow.
