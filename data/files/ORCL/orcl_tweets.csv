19/02/2020 08:19,so this is UNBELIEVABLE! Larry Ellison is a Trumpster and hosts some of the biggest fundraisers for Trump. He is on the board of $TSLA and $ORCL is beginning him to cancel it because it will hurt the brand. So technically Ellison is a hypocrite. He is an opportunist like Musk. But Ellison obviously supports a company that is trying to be green and Trump is anti-global warming. What bunch of bullshit artists. I told you this was a scam. 
19/02/2020 08:46,$TSLA If Ellison gets asked to be removed from the board because of the association with Trump. I believe it will not only hurt Elon Musk but it will hurt Tesla. Ellison is the reason why Elon Musk has calmed down. $ORCL is already putting pressure on him.
19/02/2020 10:43, pointed it out. @$@$ scum bag Ellison is holding a Trump fund raiser to protect Elon Musk from defaulting or pull some scam to protect jobs. $TSLA It is now so obvious and Ellison is getting some major heat from $ORCL backing Trump. Musk and Ellison will use anything even if it is against their principals to go to bed with the mob. I hope Musk reports some really bad revisions. There is no way he is getting away without a revision in guidance.
19/02/2020 10:46,$TSLA analysts didn&39;t look at politics and Ellison and it is not baked into the price.. Neither are the revisions in guidance. IMO they are in major problems and that is why Ellison is holding this enormous fund raiser to ask Trump a huge favor. $ORCL

I  rarely take a position into earnings. So why ORCL (other than I did my homework)? Yesterday options traders on CNBC were showing bullish option flow suggesting a pop after earnings. Also, an analyst just upgraded to Outperform with $62 tgt. And, as I read the opinions on Stocktwits - they were almost all bullish. So what did I do? I took the other side. As I&39;ve mentioned to you all before, when everyone leans one way, consider the other way as an option, it sometimes pays.   Which leads me to Jim  Bianco, a huge bear turned bull as of very recent. He gave his reasoning on CNBC today. And it certainly makes sense. However, the mkt bulls DO NOT want to see this become a pattern. Notorious bears turning bullish (a la Dennis Gartman theory). Because when the room fills up with bulls, and the siren sounds .. well, there is only one door."

Watch for a reverse to uptrend on the 5 minute and make your entry for a day trade.  If it runs to the upper area of the channel, it would be about a 6% gain for the day.  Something to try.  Large cap tend to be a little easier to trade.  6% is not a 200% penny swing, but be consistent with it, and your account will grow.  Much more attainable on a routine basis as well."

We moved to Salesforce which is stealing their customers at an enormous clip. They are desperately trying to be relevant and current. There is no innovation happening which is why they had to buy this. Mark my words they will curse this product and it will be another My Space in a few years.

No ones losing here.  ‚ÄòLarry Ellison is one of the richest men in the world, Ellison has built extensive bridges with Trump. He has vocally expressed support for the President and reportedly hosted a major fundraiser for him this year where donors who paid $100,000 were offered a chance to golf with Trump. Nor will the scrutiny be limited to Ellison; Oracle CEO Safra Catz shares close ties with Trump as well. She has donated more than $130,000 to Trump&39;s reelection efforts this year, according to Federal Election Commission data. Catz served on Trump&39;s presidential transition team in 2016 and was at one point considered for a position inside the administration. Both Catz and Ellison have served on Trump&39;s industry working groups devoted to economic revival."
17/09/2020 00:03,"$ORCL The bad: He did not look happy at all to hear the US won&39;t get a cut and that BD would maintain majority ownership. He really didn&39;t like the latter part.     The good: He doesn&39;t seem to be aware of the details so hopefully the 25k jobs this would create and the taxes the US would receive would incentivize him to sign off.     My take: I think there&39;s a chance he caves, but he seemed set on having a US company get majority stake. I think he, unfortunately, ultimately turns it down because he feels slighted by China and he hates them. The right move politically is to accept it but if I were in his position I&39;d make the emotional move and say no deal to flex on them. The deal they put together doesn&39;t really meet any of the requirements is almost insulting."

Popped up on the profitable value scan. 8 PE, consistently profitable company, in a sector I really like and think will be especially important going forward. Clearly based on how underpriced it is other people are not seeing it. Too busy having a circlejerk meeting on Zoom, I guess.  I love when I can get quality, profitable tech for undervalued prices, because it&39;s just so darn rare, as I recently saw with $INTC and $ORCL. Imo anything tech-based, that&39;s profitable, that&39;s trading undervalued, the investor needs to jump on, because the sector naturally skews toward overvaluations, which makes deep value even deeper.  Looking over toward financials: $400M cash. $1.5M current assets against $300M current debt, so $1.5B working cap. Very well-balanced company. $2B in sh equity. Trading at $2.5B. This is very, very good for a company of this size, and in this sector."
