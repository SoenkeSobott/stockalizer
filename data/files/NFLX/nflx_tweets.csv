If we&39;re right, it brings the cash returns of the business into debate, thus we downgraded NFLX to Underperform. We think NFLX can achieve the street&39;s sub growth expectations but those subs will be more expensive than investors realize. Thus far, SAC including content costs has not demonstrated meaningful cash operating leverage with NFLX still losing around $2/sub/mo (cash) despite &gt;158mm subs. New streaming competition also likely keeps content and marketing spend elevated, and potentially circumscribes ARPU growth.&quot;"

Raise to synergies and retirement of debt will drive up stock; 3) potential analyst coverage even a very modest BUY and 10x P/E = stock in the $50-$60 range not a hard call to make.  In this M&amp;A environment this will get sold in 2020.

23/01/2020 20:39,"$NFLX Yet another upgrade, $420...ignore the bears :   &quot;Sparking the bounce is a bull note from Guggenheim, which raised its NFLX price target to $420 from $400. The brokerage firm waxed optimistic on subscriber growth in international markets.  NFLX options traders are taking a bullish stance, too, with roughly 255,000 calls traded so far -- three times what&39;s typically seen, and volume pacing in the 99th annual percentile. The weekly 1/24 340-, 345-, and 350-strike calls are most active, and it looks like new positions are being purchased here. If this is the case, call buyers expect Netflix stock to continue its rebound through week&39;s end.  And with earnings in the rearview mirror, it&39;s an attractive time to purchase premium on short-term Netflix options. The stock&39;s Schaeffer&39;s Volatility Index (SVI) of 31% registers in the 6th annual percentile. In other words, near-term NFLX options have priced in lower volatility expectations just 6% of the time over the past year.&quot;"

24/01/2020 00:13,"$NFLX The company spent $2.7 billion on marketing in 2019. Cut that budget in half and you&39;ll boost Netflix&39;s earnings for the year by 70%. Making the same move would have doubled earnings in 2018. The year before that, the effect would have been a 114% bottom-line boost. The longer Netflix goes without making drastic changes to its expense structure, the closer it gets to achieving a similar earnings boost in an organic manner -- simply adding millions and millions of subscribers to balance out the rising ad budget and keep the growth trend alive."
24/01/2020 00:14,"$NFLX Netflix is building a long-term cash machine here. Value investors will come to appreciate it later but you can get started right now. Or maybe you&39;ve seen this growth story develop for years already, pocketing a 460% return in five years and a 4,400% boost over the last decade. In that case, just shrug your shoulders over Wednesday&39;s 4% drop and continue to enjoy Netflix&39;s wealth-building muscle for many years to come."
24/01/2020 00:22,"$NFLX as expected, Cramer now bigging up Netflix after threatening to kick it out of FAANG not long ago. It is very cheap for a World Wide market leader. Tesla can build plants in China...Netflix are potentially right there already, in every room, in every house in the World!!"
24/01/2020 00:25,$NFLX lol
24/01/2020 00:27,"$NFLX Viewing per subscriber actually grew This is the most important nugget of information from the whole report: The average Netflix subscriber watched more Netflix this fourth quarter, both globally and in the U.S., than in the same quarter a year ago. That&39;s a very telling data point. The assumption is that at least some U.S.-based Netflix subscribers would at least try out Apple TV+ or Disney+ this past quarter considering they just launched, and that would lead them to watch less Netflix. Instead, per-subscriber engagement increased during the quarter. This is likely due to a rapid increase in original content over the past year, including a big fourth-quarter content slate that included Oscar-nominated films like The Irishman, Marriage Story, Two Popes, Klaus, and American Factory."
24/01/2020 00:30,"$NFLX Netflix has been testing cheaper mobile-only subscription plans in emerging markets like India over the past year or so. Some of these markets have significant numbers of smartphone users who may not have fixed internet connections in their households, so it makes sense to offer a plan that targets this subscribing segment. That strategy appears to be working, which is helping increase revenue in these markets. And revenue growth is everything for Netflix because it allows even more content spending, which improves the service even more, driving more subscribers and revenue in a virtuous cycle.  Management also suggested the mobile-only plan may be appropriate for additional markets, and it may test more types of subscription plans. It&39;s possible Netflix could test out the appeal of annual subscription plans at a discount in some international markets. The international markets are where most of Netflix&39;s future growth lies, so investors should be paying attention to this."

Not only do Eros execs have the best qualifications to identify the right content that $AMZN  $NFLX  $AAPL  &amp; others want &amp; need in India but Eros has already laid out the groundwork to obtain the content. Don&39;t think for a second that Eros did not already have options locked up on this content.

The percentage of TV watching that is now done through streaming has almost doubled since 2018, according to the new Nielsen February Total Audience Report"

The data also show, however, that almost half of viewers subscribe to three or more streaming services, while about 60% subscribe to at least two. Only 10% subscribe to four or more.

She is very well spoken and I really like what she has to say.     She describes how Eros is in early days yet has a large library &quot;no&quot; they are &quot;Definitely Not interested&quot; in selling their library with other OTT&39;s because they are just getting started. Also, &quot;We don&39;t just want to be a taste curator, we want to be a taste maker&quot; &quot;stories will win&quot; She says!     Sound like they are really trying to take a page out of the $NFLX  playbook which is fine with me.     Eros is a content value/growth play, while India has a massive population that is just getting some decent internet coverage &amp; speeds as we speak. Eros is priced like a dumpster fire.

Of the other 3, one is the head of Amazon Prime India, one is the head of Netflix India and the other represents Eros International. Pretty solid company!

Seem this resulted from trump administration health  officials who came to assist in transfer of people with virus flown in from Japan to be quarantined. Seems the health officials failed to take proper precautions when dealing with virus patients and unintentionally became infected, and spread disease by going out into community which allowed virus to get out to local community. This has begun spread of cases in California. Not realizing they were carriers of virus they then went to airports, boarded planes and flew back, potentially spreading virus to people they came into contact with... within weeks the results will be widespread transmission. .."

Instead of being in school, my kids and Wife are at home streaming video most of these days when they normally wouldn&39;t be. Streaming video will likely turn out the best (only) place to be for (hyper) growth during this Wuhan virus worldwide meltdown.     Think about this: NFLX trades at 18x book value.  while Eros trades at 0.30x times book value. So Netflix is trading at 60x book multiple of Eros and this is all while new kid on the block ( started with zero subscribers about 5 yrs ago) Eros is still growing paid subscribers at a 50% per year growth rate. The revenue and profit from low cost based Eros is about to flood in this yr.    Photo taken from one of my watchlists at todays close."

Netflix&39;s first-quarter guidance was for $5.7 billion in revenue, profits of $1.66 a share, and 7 million net new subscribers. The Street consensus calls for $5.74 billion and $1.64 a share. But the focus is going to be on new subscribers during the quarter -- and expectations for the second quarter.  Netflix (ticker: NFLX) has almost certainly gained viewers -- and streaming hours -- in recent weeks, as billions of people hunker down at home. Following a huge jump in streaming subscribers for Walt Disney (DIS) and a 49% spike in first-quarter streaming hours at Roku (ROKU), expectations are mounting for Netflix&39;s latest results."

14/05/2020 15:00,"$NFLX Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo initiated coverage of Netflix Inc. shares (NFLX) with a buy rating Thursday, writing that the company has a &quot;vastly underappreciated&quot; total addressable market. He predicts that Netflix will continue to show double-digit subscriber growth through 2023 that will lift the company to about 285 million subscribers by then. &quot; Our model assumes just 28% international penetration by 2023, vs our estimate of 18% today,&quot; he wrote, while also assuming that U.S. penetration stays constant at about 65%. He calculates that Netflix&39;s total addressable market can grow to more than 850 million when taking into account broadband households and mobile-only subscribers. Giaimo set a $ 520 price target on the stock,"

That‚Äôs not a knock on any gaming company; I just think this is the reality of things.

09/06/2020 12:07,"$AAPL $NFLX June 8, 2020 02:16 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst Color  Apple Inc.&39;s (NASDAQ:AAPL) streaming service Apple TV+, which is part of the Services segment and was launched November 2019, should be on the radar of investors, according to Gene Munster of Loup Ventures.   Stay-At-Home Boost For Apple TV+: The stay-at-home&39;orders that boosted Netflix Inc&39;s (NASDAQ:NFLX) paid member growth by 64% is also benefiting Apple TV+ growth, Munster said in a note.  Although the stay-at-home tailwind is short-lived, the long-term outlook for streaming services remains favorable, the research analyst-turned-venture capitalist said.   At its one-year anniversary mark in November, Apple TV+ will have about 40 million to 50 million active subscribers and less than 5 million paid subscribers, according to Munster&39;s estimates.    Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb both ranked Apple TV+ in line with other streaming services, he said."

Netflix also achieved very high customer satisfaction levels, with 87% reporting they were &quot;extremely/very satisfied.&quot; Even more importantly, those that said they were &quot;not at all satisfied&quot; came in far below 1%.  Four of the Top 5 most watched shows in Mexico were local language originals, which Mahaney says represents &quot;a distinct positive for Netflix&39;s competitive position in Mexico [and Latin America].&quot; Additionally the streaming giant has proved to be even more popular among global viewers than it does in the U.S. &quot;So far all international markets have consistently shown higher satisfaction scores than the U.S., which has major implications,&quot;"

24/06/2020 14:11,"$EROS Look at what has happened with Covid vaccine stocks here recently like $INO and $ALT. Look at $ZM and $NFLX. When the virus first hit, just about everyone knew that these types of stocks should be able to easily take advantage, but the price didn&39;t take off until investors actually saw the results. Anyone who knows the first thing about $EROS knows that sub numbers have to be going up, they know that huge revenue from ads is there for the taking, but it actually has to happen for the price to go up. Investors LOVE certainty. They want to be absolutely certain that this company is going to start raking in alot more cash. We won&39;t have that certainty and confidence until after the ER on 7-15 when the 3 year guidance is laid out. Even then, there will still be plenty of room for the SP to go up when they ACTUALLY start reporting that they are meeting/exceeding their 3 year guidance. Again, investors LOVE certainty and they are willing to pay for it."

The stay at home measures, according to market research firm Nielsen, resulted in streaming figures more than doubling during the pandemic‚Äôs peak in comparison to the same period last year.

As Netflix has ownership on one of the biggest content libraries among streaming services, it has an advantage over competitors. Moreover, with various projects in post-production, content hungry users should remain well-fed for the foreseeable future.

The Netflix Analyst: Douglas Mitchelson maintained an Outperform rating on Netflix and hiked the price target from $465 to $550.   The Netflix Thesis: Netflix app downloads climbed 42% year-over-year, accelerating from the 30% growth in the first quarter, Mitchelson said in a note. (See his track record here.)  The growth reflected strong underlying trends that have been helped by shelter-in-place, reduced competition from other media avenues, momentum building in Asia, content success and a lack of price increases, the analyst said.   Credit Suisse now estimates global net adds of 10.55 million, ahead of the company&39;s guidance of 7.5 million."

The stock closed Thursday up $4.98 to $507.76. The analyst expects Netflix to report Q2 results &quot;well above guidance&quot; with at least 12.5M net subscriber additions. Quarterly app downloads reached a record high and year-over-year downloads growth reached its highest level since Q1 of 2016 during the quarter, Terry tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. The analyst attributes this to content growth on the platform, a lack of competition for entertainment hours and spend driving churn lower, and more time being spent at home during COVID-19. Further, Terry believes consensus estimates for the second half of 2020 and beyond remain too low."

It should top 195 million global streaming paid memberships by September, and this will be a record year by most measuring sticks. History will likely view the Sarandos promotion as a very positive move. Thursday&39;s report wasn&39;t perfect, but Netflix continues to be one of the market&39;s strongest growth stocks. &quot; "

Something we talked about last week and in the sentiment report is the expectation of further rotation from overvalued tech into non tech industries. Hoping the rotation will continue into airlines, other travel and energy companies.  Then again, these megacaps - $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $FB, $GOOG, TSLA drive indexes which means they are protected. NFLX was down to ~450 after ER (which really wasn&39;t that bad i might add) and everyone was saying NFLX would be a bellwether for further tech ER. Nope, that&39;s not how it works. Any dip will create a buying opportunity despite the overvalued stock performances. Unless there is a concerted effort from quants to kill the megacaps, i don&39;t imagine a 200DMA pullback will happen anytime soon.

Roku is focusing every ounce of effort on maximizing its subscriber counts and revenue growth, paving the way toward incredibly profitable results many years down the road. That&39;s exactly how Netflix built a $217 billion market cap.  Roku could certainly have picked a worse role model than Netflix. And you would think that Roku would be an obvious winner in the stay-at-home era of COVID-19 mitigation, but neither analysts nor market makers seem to have caught on. The stock is up only 10% in 2020, just ahead of the broader market&39;s 5% gain and a long way behind fellow coronavirus winner Netflix at 52%."

Why fight with bulls and scalping day traders on a super optimistic green day, when you can save your fire power and fight on a red day (like today) and have more chance at winning?  If you&39;ve got a good average, sit tight or average down for the anticipated upward movement after the holiday.  And for those of you that like options, be careful and conservative.  I don&39;t care who they hire, with this float we&39;re not going to $15 this year.   Link in bio for SMS/text alerts.  Have a great trading day.  $NFLX $ROKU"

It&39;s total nonsense to say 8 times as many have cancelled as opposed to August...as a whole month. It varies day to day...but overall many MORE people are subscribing around the World.  YipitData declined to provide estimates on the number of customers who cancelled. Customers regularly drop Netflix and other subscription services (a metric referred to as ‚Äúchurn rate‚Äù), and the YipitData numbers may ultimately reflect a short-term blip in U.S. cancellations that is relatively minor in a grand scheme of things. As of the end of June, the company tallied 193 million paid streaming customers worldwide.

EPS came in below consensus, while revenue beat the Street estimate of $6.38 billion.  Cramer told CNBC viewers ‚Äújust go buy it.‚Äù  He&39;s surprised to see shares fall after reporting what he called a good quarter: ‚ÄúWas anyone on the call with negative things?‚Äù  Cramer believes the conference call acted as a huge advertisement for the company as it highlighted upcoming content for the streaming provider.  ‚ÄúI mean holy cow,‚Äù Cramer said to the reaction of sellers of the stock, calling this ‚Äúanother assault on Netflix.‚Äù  Ultimately, Cramer said buyers will come back to Netflix after realizing this was a good quarter."

09/12/2020 14:12,"$TSNP I&39;m as guilty as the next pumper on ST cross-promoting their penny picks, but let me get the record straight...there is no &quot;next&quot; TSNP. I&39;m in 11 penny stocks (read my posts to see what I&39;m bullish on) and they&39;re all doing well; however, NONE of them compare to the potential of TSNP.  Even at these levels, TSNP can realistically run 50x to 10+ in the short term. Additionally, no other OTC stock has the potential to run to 100+ in the next 3-5 years. We&39;ve read those articles on how much you could have made if you invested in  $AMZN, $NFLX, or $TSLA early. THIS is your opportunity.  Now I have seen a lot of skepticism around the product and its release. You have to ask yourself what the potential could be IF everything went as planned. $QS won&39;t have revenue until 2025 and the hype drove it to 70+. A lot can go wrong until then, but if that battery tech is as revolutionary as they claim, it will have global implications. The same could be said for HUMBL.  "
