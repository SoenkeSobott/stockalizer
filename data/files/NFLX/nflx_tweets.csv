(NASDAQ: NFLX) earnings, which reported Tuesday after the market closed.  What Happened: Netflix reported earnings of $1.74 per share and $6.44 billion in the third quarter. EPS came in below consensus, while revenue beat the Street estimate of $6.38 billion.  Cramer told CNBC viewers “just go buy it.”  He&39;s surprised to see shares fall after reporting what he called a good quarter: “Was anyone on the call with negative things?”  Cramer believes the conference call acted as a huge advertisement for the company as it highlighted upcoming content for the streaming provider.  “I mean holy cow,” Cramer said to the reaction of sellers of the stock, calling this “another assault on Netflix.”  Ultimately, Cramer said buyers will come back to Netflix after realizing this was a good quarter."

2020-09-16 22:36:30,"$NFLX Likely a beat coming next ER.  August data from ANTENNA suggests Netflix’s churn was 2.97% for the month, up from 2.72% in July and 2.93% in August 2019, the analyst said.  SimilarWeb data for the month suggests global cancelation queries were down to 1.11% in August from 1.67% in July and 1.27% in August 2019, he said.   The August data is good enough overall to support a potential subscriber beat when Netflix reports third-quarter earnings, Schindler said."
2020-09-16 22:29:20,"$NFLX For those idiots saying that 8 times more people have cancelled or whatever nonsense, no, the &quot;data&quot;(no actual numbers were given) was for the daily average on one specific day, Sept 12th. It&39;s total nonsense to say 8 times as many have cancelled as opposed to August...as a whole month. It varies day to day...but overall many MORE people are subscribing around the World.  YipitData declined to provide estimates on the number of customers who cancelled. Customers regularly drop Netflix and other subscription services (a metric referred to as “churn rate”), and the YipitData numbers may ultimately reflect a short-term blip in U.S. cancellations that is relatively minor in a grand scheme of things. As of the end of June, the company tallied 193 million paid streaming customers worldwide. That’s after Netflix netted about 25.9 million new subscribers worldwide in the first six months of 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic spurring record signups."

2020-09-03 11:49:44,"$EROS Erosians, I said last week that I thought the premature run up before September was a bull trap/options carrot.  Don&39;t be too off put by this pullback (before Labor Day no less).  Remember, shorts still have A LOT of shares outstanding and just because they borrow them, it doesn&39;t mean they intend to use them everyday they&39;re loaned.  Why fight with bulls and scalping day traders on a super optimistic green day, when you can save your fire power and fight on a red day (like today) and have more chance at winning?  If you&39;ve got a good average, sit tight or average down for the anticipated upward movement after the holiday.  And for those of you that like options, be careful and conservative.  I don&39;t care who they hire, with this float we&39;re not going to $15 this year.   Link in bio for SMS/text alerts.  Have a great trading day.  $NFLX $ROKU"

That&39;s exactly how Netflix built a $217 billion market cap.  Roku could certainly have picked a worse role model than Netflix. And you would think that Roku would be an obvious winner in the stay-at-home era of COVID-19 mitigation, but neither analysts nor market makers seem to have caught on. The stock is up only 10% in 2020, just ahead of the broader market&39;s 5% gain and a long way behind fellow coronavirus winner Netflix at 52%."

2020-07-20 12:34:52,"also need to keep a close watch on the correlation between nasdaq and SPX this week. Something we talked about last week and in the sentiment report is the expectation of further rotation from overvalued tech into non tech industries. Hoping the rotation will continue into airlines, other travel and energy companies.  Then again, these megacaps - $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $FB, $GOOG, TSLA drive indexes which means they are protected. NFLX was down to ~450 after ER (which really wasn&39;t that bad i might add) and everyone was saying NFLX would be a bellwether for further tech ER. Nope, that&39;s not how it works. Any dip will create a buying opportunity despite the overvalued stock performances. Unless there is a concerted effort from quants to kill the megacaps, i don&39;t imagine a 200DMA pullback will happen anytime soon.

Tech has been overvalued for some time and this could very well be foreshadowing of things to come for these bloated stocks. Hopefully it doesn&39;t spill too much over in other industries but that is usually how things go unfortunately...  We did see a good amount of rotation out of tech yesterday into other industries like travel, leisure and energy, so we&39;ll see what happens tomorrow. The good news is these people are greedy af and will look to panic sell tech and find undervalued or cheap non tech stocks most likely.

2020-07-13 12:57:54,"$NFLX $ROKU “If you control the TV OS platform, you can advantage your native apps relative to third-party competitors (think Roku Channel to Prime Video/Prime Music/IMDB.TV to Apple Music/Apple TV/Apple Arcade to YouTube/YouTube TV/Stadia) and leverage learnings from usage of competitive apps on the platform,” he writes. You can also collect data and create an interdependent home ecosystem of products, enhanced by artificial intelligence. “You quickly realize just how important it is to be a winner in the TV OS battle.”  No wonder then, that big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon are so eager to make their mark in the space, along with more media-focused rivals like Roku and Netflix (NFLX).  So who will win this prize? It’s too early to tell, Greenfield says. Many times we’ve seen single-purpose companies win, which would point to contenders like Roku."

Just for fun and as a reference we put out a video as a Buy reiteration of AMZN back in August 2012 when the stock was trading around $240/share ... so this one had a run of approx. +1,328% since then ... not as spectacular in percentage terms as $NFLX of course, but steady growth ... and we&39;ve been trading AMZN since it went public over two decades ago ... we love that company and I know tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of folks to.

2020-07-10 13:06:50,"$NFLX $ROKU   Netflix price target raised to $670 from $540 at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry raised the firm&39;s price target on Netflix to $670 from $540 and reiterates a Conviction Buy rating on the shares. The stock closed Thursday up $4.98 to $507.76. The analyst expects Netflix to report Q2 results &quot;well above guidance&quot; with at least 12.5M net subscriber additions. Quarterly app downloads reached a record high and year-over-year downloads growth reached its highest level since Q1 of 2016 during the quarter, Terry tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. The analyst attributes this to content growth on the platform, a lack of competition for entertainment hours and spend driving churn lower, and more time being spent at home during COVID-19. Further, Terry believes consensus estimates for the second half of 2020 and beyond remain too low."

The Netflix Analyst: Douglas Mitchelson maintained an Outperform rating on Netflix and hiked the price target from $465 to $550.   The Netflix Thesis: Netflix app downloads climbed 42% year-over-year, accelerating from the 30% growth in the first quarter, Mitchelson said in a note. (See his track record here.)  The growth reflected strong underlying trends that have been helped by shelter-in-place, reduced competition from other media avenues, momentum building in Asia, content success and a lack of price increases, the analyst said.   Credit Suisse now estimates global net adds of 10.55 million, ahead of the company&39;s guidance of 7.5 million."

Add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality TV shows and docuseries, “with the two genres representing over 20% of the top 10 most popular TV series during Q2,” and you get Ripps’ point.  . As Netflix has ownership on one of the biggest content libraries among streaming services, it has an advantage over competitors. Moreover, with various projects in post-production, content hungry users should remain well-fed for the foreseeable future.  Ripps, accordingly, reiterates a Buy on Netflix shares along with a $550 price target. What’s in it for investors? Potential upside of 11.5%."

No doubt, Netflix has been one of the companies to benefit the most from the pandemic. The stay at home measures, according to market research firm Nielsen, resulted in streaming figures more than doubling during the pandemic’s peak in comparison to the same period last year.

We won&39;t have that certainty and confidence until after the ER on 7-15 when the 3 year guidance is laid out.

2020-06-09 12:07:07,"$AAPL $NFLX June 8, 2020 02:16 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst Color  Apple Inc.&39;s (NASDAQ:AAPL) streaming service Apple TV+, which is part of the Services segment and was launched November 2019, should be on the radar of investors, according to Gene Munster of Loup Ventures.   Stay-At-Home Boost For Apple TV+: The stay-at-home&39;orders that boosted Netflix Inc&39;s (NASDAQ:NFLX) paid member growth by 64% is also benefiting Apple TV+ growth, Munster said in a note.  Although the stay-at-home tailwind is short-lived, the long-term outlook for streaming services remains favorable, the research analyst-turned-venture capitalist said.   At its one-year anniversary mark in November, Apple TV+ will have about 40 million to 50 million active subscribers and less than 5 million paid subscribers, according to Munster&39;s estimates.    Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb both ranked Apple TV+ in line with other streaming services, he said."

Entertainment one (Peppa Pig and PJ Masks) was bought by Hasbro for $4 billion basically to have exclusive rights to the merch. We already have a contract with Mattel so thats a possible channel. $AMZN has been know to buy entire companies to get select shows. We have a contract with Amazon. We also have shows with $NFLX $BABA and $VIAC all big players with deep pockets. Apple is in desperate need of relevant content to truly break out in the streaming market.  Do you think its a coincidence that they have distributed shows to every major player? I sure don&39;t. I think its brilliant.

2020-05-21 19:22:18,"$ZNGA I really think if a company is going to purchase ZNGA it’s going to be a media company that wants a new covid-proof vertical and seeks the ability to monetize the income stream through an existing subscription model and then packaging the games as extensions to already branded media content. I can see this being a fit for two companies especially, $NFLX and $DIS.  I personally think most games across most all platforms are pretty weakly themed.  That’s not a knock on any gaming company; I just think this is the reality of things.  A media company seems like a solution to create more widely-relatable brand identity to what can be a living and breathing extension and indulgence of other original content.  Kind of like a souvenir shop at the exit of a theme park. You get to enjoy the souvenir until you’re back again at the theme park or hotel or back watching the show you enjoy the next day."

They raised it from a measly 170 Million in 2015. They only have around 500 million shares distributed. Thats 10%. Most companies have shares in reserves. You will not have your shares diluted tomorrow at noon no matter how this goes. A distribution of shares would have to be voted on during another meeting later on.  The board of directors owns a huge chunk of shares. They lose themselves money by dilution. Why would they do that???

However, the 1hr techs are mixed. I think volume will win and this will go up, but I’m not sure if it will sustain. On a fundamental level it should. Everyone picked Netflix even over Disney to stream this pandemic.  Based in this setup, if I were to play (which I won’t because I don’t like large caps) it seems like 413 is the support, so a 409 SL might be safe and effective if it sells off.

If Netflix does great and triples revs by 2027 to $75B, and does awesome in somehow getting to 10% free cash flow, that is $7.5B per year. Meanwhile, let’s say Disney continues to suffer next year and only makes 7 1/2 billion in free cash flow and just $15B by 2022. By 2027 with Disney+ and Hulu are free cash flow positive and other areas are slowly growing, so it makes $22B free cash by 2027. Which would you value more highly?"

I would check the box stating that my DVD was “lost in the mail” and that I would like a new one sent out. I did this with every DVD I ever got from them. They are all at my house and I still have the old white Disc sleeves they game in branded “Netflix”. Netflix stock was $6 back then. Fast forward 11 years. Netflix is now worth $440 a share.

Netflix&39;s first-quarter guidance was for $5.7 billion in revenue, profits of $1.66 a share, and 7 million net new subscribers. The Street consensus calls for $5.74 billion and $1.64 a share. But the focus is going to be on new subscribers during the quarter -- and expectations for the second quarter.  Netflix (ticker: NFLX) has almost certainly gained viewers -- and streaming hours -- in recent weeks, as billions of people hunker down at home. Following a huge jump in streaming subscribers for Walt Disney (DIS) and a 49% spike in first-quarter streaming hours at Roku (ROKU), expectations are mounting for Netflix&39;s latest results."

His new target is higher than all those listed on FactSet. The price-target change came as Wlodarczak &quot;materially&quot; raised his subscriber estimates, citing &quot;likely higher gross subscribers and lower subscriber churn boosted by global consumer &39;stay-at-home&39; orders around COVID-19.&quot; He thinks the crisis is &quot;cementing Netflix&39;s global [direct-to- consumer] dominance&quot; as the company spent heavily to create a robust library of programming. &quot;The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows (and their [average revenue per user] increases) the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service (and reduces existing subscriber churn),&quot; he wrote."

He wants Congress to spend more on sending cash directly to American, the people said.    The McConnell bill plans to give tax rebates to individuals of $1,200 and $2,400 for married couples, plus $500 for children.    In the McConnell plan, rebates would be completely phased out for taxpayers with incomes of over $99,000 for individuals or $198,000 for a couple."

And Netflix announced they are cutting their traffic stream to Europe through definition quality reduction to reduce bandwidth hogging. I can only imagine the bandwidth getting sucked up these days. Instead of being in school, my kids and Wife are at home streaming video most of these days when they normally wouldn&39;t be. Streaming video will likely turn out the best (only) place to be for (hyper) growth during this Wuhan virus worldwide meltdown.     Think about this: NFLX trades at 18x book value.  while Eros trades at 0.30x times book value. So Netflix is trading at 60x book multiple of Eros and this is all while new kid on the block ( started with zero subscribers about 5 yrs ago) Eros is still growing paid subscribers at a 50% per year growth rate. The revenue and profit from low cost based Eros is about to flood in this yr.    Photo taken from one of my watchlists at todays close."

He was dead right in 2008, even if his timing — well, let’s just say he was ill-advised — maybe left a little bit to be desired. I think he’s going to turn out to be right this time, too,” the “Mad Money” host said.        “Just, please, if you’re going to buy, buy gradually on the way down,” he advised in a turbulent market environment."

Seems the health officials failed to take proper precautions when dealing with virus patients and unintentionally became infected, and spread disease by going out into community which allowed virus to get out to local community. This has begun spread of cases in California. Not realizing they were carriers of virus they then went to airports, boarded planes and flew back, potentially spreading virus to people they came into contact with... within weeks the results will be widespread transmission. .."

And while Disney Plus got off to a hot original-content start with The Mandalorian, it&39;s slowed down on originals while Netflix keeps releasing programs, he says.    “We believe Netflix is in a unique position to benefit from a solid content lineup, normalization of competitive landscape, and increased consumer time spent indoors.&quot;    $DIS $XLK $SPY"

Its 2020 original titles include David Fincher’s “Mank,” a remake of “Rebecca” with Lily James and Armie Hammer, Spike Lee’s “Da 5 Bloods,” Charlie Kaufman’s “I’m Thinking of Ending Things,” Ron Howard’s “Hillbilly Elegy,” Ryan Murphy’s “Prom Queen,” and the Sundance documentary “Crip Camp.” All of these have the potential to be prime titles from the perspective of a mainstream distributor, and bolstering the theatrical staff suggests Netflix will continue to try to break into more theaters."

Also, &quot;We don&39;t just want to be a taste curator, we want to be a taste maker&quot; &quot;stories will win&quot; She says!     Sound like they are really trying to take a page out of the $NFLX  playbook which is fine with me.     Eros is a content value/growth play, while India has a massive population that is just getting some decent internet coverage &amp; speeds as we speak. Eros is priced like a dumpster fire. What&39;s not to like?    I urge you to view this video. It is long so about two minutes does the trick between around 52:30 minutes and 54:30 min.        Go $EROS"

Not only do Eros execs have the best qualifications to identify the right content that $AMZN  $NFLX  $AAPL  &amp; others want &amp; need in India but Eros has already laid out the groundwork to obtain the content. Don&39;t think for a second that Eros did not already have options locked up on this content. These content rights would have been negotiated and locked up prior to the current content &quot;land grab&quot; attempts which the big boys are are scrambling to pull off right now.

2020-01-24 00:30:53,"$NFLX Netflix has been testing cheaper mobile-only subscription plans in emerging markets like India over the past year or so. Some of these markets have significant numbers of smartphone users who may not have fixed internet connections in their households, so it makes sense to offer a plan that targets this subscribing segment. That strategy appears to be working, which is helping increase revenue in these markets. And revenue growth is everything for Netflix because it allows even more content spending, which improves the service even more, driving more subscribers and revenue in a virtuous cycle.  Management also suggested the mobile-only plan may be appropriate for additional markets, and it may test more types of subscription plans. It&39;s possible Netflix could test out the appeal of annual subscription plans at a discount in some international markets. The international markets are where most of Netflix&39;s future growth lies, so investors should be paying attention to this."
2020-01-24 00:27:05,"$NFLX Viewing per subscriber actually grew This is the most important nugget of information from the whole report: The average Netflix subscriber watched more Netflix this fourth quarter, both globally and in the U.S., than in the same quarter a year ago. That&39;s a very telling data point. The assumption is that at least some U.S.-based Netflix subscribers would at least try out Apple TV+ or Disney+ this past quarter considering they just launched, and that would lead them to watch less Netflix. Instead, per-subscriber engagement increased during the quarter. This is likely due to a rapid increase in original content over the past year, including a big fourth-quarter content slate that included Oscar-nominated films like The Irishman, Marriage Story, Two Popes, Klaus, and American Factory."

2020-01-24 00:22:53,"$NFLX as expected, Cramer now bigging up Netflix after threatening to kick it out of FAANG not long ago. It is very cheap for a World Wide market leader. Tesla can build plants in China...Netflix are potentially right there already, in every room, in every house in the World!!"
2020-01-24 00:14:49,"$NFLX Netflix is building a long-term cash machine here. Value investors will come to appreciate it later but you can get started right now. Or maybe you&39;ve seen this growth story develop for years already, pocketing a 460% return in five years and a 4,400% boost over the last decade. In that case, just shrug your shoulders over Wednesday&39;s 4% drop and continue to enjoy Netflix&39;s wealth-building muscle for many years to come."
2020-01-24 00:13:52,"$NFLX The company spent $2.7 billion on marketing in 2019. Cut that budget in half and you&39;ll boost Netflix&39;s earnings for the year by 70%. Making the same move would have doubled earnings in 2018. The year before that, the effect would have been a 114% bottom-line boost. The longer Netflix goes without making drastic changes to its expense structure, the closer it gets to achieving a similar earnings boost in an organic manner -- simply adding millions and millions of subscribers to balance out the rising ad budget and keep the growth trend alive."

2020-01-23 20:39:16,"$NFLX Yet another upgrade, $420...ignore the bears :   &quot;Sparking the bounce is a bull note from Guggenheim, which raised its NFLX price target to $420 from $400. The brokerage firm waxed optimistic on subscriber growth in international markets.  NFLX options traders are taking a bullish stance, too, with roughly 255,000 calls traded so far -- three times what&39;s typically seen, and volume pacing in the 99th annual percentile. The weekly 1/24 340-, 345-, and 350-strike calls are most active, and it looks like new positions are being purchased here. If this is the case, call buyers expect Netflix stock to continue its rebound through week&39;s end.  And with earnings in the rearview mirror, it&39;s an attractive time to purchase premium on short-term Netflix options. The stock&39;s Schaeffer&39;s Volatility Index (SVI) of 31% registers in the 6th annual percentile. In other words, near-term NFLX options have priced in lower volatility expectations just 6% of the time over the past year.&quot;"

Unless the other vendors can crank out massive amounts of new good content they won’t compete as much as suspected. With DIsney plus people will pay for a while to keep the classics and newer movies in a vault at their beckoned call but eventually Disney will need to crank out tons of new content to keep them.

The company defines a view as watching at least 70% of the program.  Sarandos explained at a recent UBS Global conference that it&39;s difficult to measure how much a specific piece of content drives subscriptions in a given period, but the strategy behind big-budget feature films lies in boosting the “value proposition&quot; for consumers.   He compared watching &quot;The Irishman&quot; to “a $100 night out” that viewers can enjoy at home instead. “I think it translates into how they value Netflix,” he said."

The bottom line is Eros has something the big boys ( $AMZN $MSFT $AAPL $NFLX ) want as they all jostle for position in India.

2019-11-25 14:22:07,"$NFLX Netflix: Wells Fargo downgrades on FCF concerns, says spending levels should remain elevated to acquire subs from competition  (310.48)  Wells Fargo&39;s Steven Cahall downgraded NFLX to Underperform from Market Perform with a $265 price target, down from $308; specifically, &quot;We&39;ve dug deep into our NFLX cash estimates and have conviction in our 2019-25E cumulative FCF forecast that&39;s $18bn below the street. If we&39;re right, it brings the cash returns of the business into debate, thus we downgraded NFLX to Underperform. We think NFLX can achieve the street&39;s sub growth expectations but those subs will be more expensive than investors realize. Thus far, SAC including content costs has not demonstrated meaningful cash operating leverage with NFLX still losing around $2/sub/mo (cash) despite &gt;158mm subs. New streaming competition also likely keeps content and marketing spend elevated, and potentially circumscribes ARPU growth.&quot;"
